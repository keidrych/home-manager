# Writing Home Manager Modules {#ch-writing-modules}

The module system in Home Manager is based entirely on the NixOS module
system so we will here only highlight aspects that are specific for Home
Manager. For information about the module system as such please refer to
the [Writing NixOS
Modules](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-writing-modules)
chapter of the NixOS manual.
