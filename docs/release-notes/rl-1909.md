# Release 19.09 {#sec-release-19.09}

The 19.09 release branch became the stable branch in October, 2019.

## Highlights {#sec-release-19.09-highlights}

This release has the following notable changes:

-   The `programs.firefox.enableGoogleTalk` and
    `programs.firefox.enableIcedTea` options are now deprecated and will
    only work if Firefox ESR 52.x is used.

-   The `home-manager` tool now provides an `uninstall` sub-command that
    can be used to uninstall Home Manager, if used in the standalone
    mode. That is, not as a NixOS module.

## State Version Changes {#sec-release-19.09-state-version-changes}

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
\"19.09\" or later.

-   The [programs.firefox.package](#opt-programs.firefox.package) option now expects a
    wrapped Firefox package and defaults to `pkgs.firefox`.

-   The options [home.keyboard.layout](#opt-home.keyboard.layout) and
    [home.keyboard.variant](#opt-home.keyboard.variant) now default to `null`, which
    indicates that the system value should be used.
