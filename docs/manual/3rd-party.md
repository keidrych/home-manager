# Third-Party Tools and Extensions {#ch-3rd-party}

Here is a collection of tools and extensions that relate to Home
Manager. Note, these are maintained outside the regular Home Manager
flow so quality and support may vary wildly. If you encounter problems
then please raise them in the corresponding project, not as issues in
the Home Manager tracker.

If you have made something interesting related to Home Manager then you
are encouraged to create a PR that expands this chapter.
